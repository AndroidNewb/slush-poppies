Slush &amp; Poppies
===================

This is a custom port of SublimeText's theme **Slush &amp; Poppies** for *Notepad++*

Pretty much a work in progress, the end product would be fine tuned for PHP, CSS, JS and HTML mostly.

Works with font [Source Code Pro](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/)
